# Decision Tree Classifier - Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of a **Decision Tree Classifier** to solve a classification problem using a supervised learning approach. The model is built using the **scikit-learn** library in Python.

It is developed as part of my internship project to explore machine learning concepts such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading** – Load the dataset using pandas.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale the data.
3. **Train-Test Split** – Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Training** – Train a Decision Tree Classifier using `scikit-learn`.
5. **Prediction & Evaluation** – Predict on the test set and evaluate using accuracy score and confusion matrix.
6. **Visualization** – Visualize the decision tree and performance metrics.
